            <h2>Name Etymology</h2>
            <p>The name for Pangasinan was coined through the word “panag asinan,” which was further derived from the prefix “pang-,” which has the same use as the word “for,” and the root word “asin” meaning “salt.” With this, the name “Pangasinan” essentially means “place of salt” or “place of salt-making.”</p>
